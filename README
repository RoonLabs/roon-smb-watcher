This is a hopefully small program that watches for SMB shares on the local network and interacts with host program over stdin/stdout

To build:
get build tools installed:
meson ninja automake autoconf libtool
./build.sh

Usage:
roon_smb_watcher test [workgroup] [username] [password]
roon_smb_watcher hosts
roon_smb_watcher shares [workgroup] [username] [password]

workgroup, username, and password are all optional.  if only one
extra argument is provided, it's treated as a username, if two
they are treated as username and password in that order

roon_smb_watcher test
this is meant as manual tool to confirm that the watcher works.  it prints
every host found, attempts to log in with both the supplied credentials if
any and username="Guest", password="password", and lists all shares found

roon_smb_watcher hosts
this is meant as a utility used by Roon to list computers with network
shares on the local network.  It prints one line per change event, using
formatting like this:
<event type> <ip address> <workgroup>/<host name>

where:
* <event type> can be "added" or "removed"
* <ip address> is in dotted decimal notation, like "192.168.1.1", as output
  from `inet_ntoa`
* <workgroup> and <host name> are the netbios workgroup and host name

This mode never returns, it assumes the caller will simply kill it
after some timeout

roon_smb_watcher shares <server> [workgroup] [username] [password]
this is meant as a utility used by Roon to list shares on a particular
host.

Parameters:
* <server> can be either a netbios/dns name, or an
